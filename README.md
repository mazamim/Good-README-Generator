  ## The Project to generate easy and modern way to generate readme files

  - Motivation of Project :-
   I've struggled with writing READMEs for my projects from the day I started to learn developing.

  - Why this project?
   You might want to show your project to your friend. Or your future employer might want to check your existing Github projects. Switching between projects in your work is common, let alone that you might need to poke at your own previous projects from time to time.
